## ðŸ“Œ Assignment Summary

This assignment challenged me to think like a real DevOps Engineer, thus I present you BrewOps (pun intended). It is a lightweight cafe management system implemented to simulate real-world operations in service industry.

The project served as a playground for me to practice DevOps fundamentals including CI/CD, Containerization, Release Automation and so much more.
